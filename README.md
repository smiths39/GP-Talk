GP-Talk
=======

There is currently a large gap in the Irish medical sector that contains a potential opportunity to thrive convenience and immediacy. GP Talk is an Android application that fully automates the menial tasks associated with booking and managing patient appointments. The engagement between a General Practitioner and a patient is increased through real-time, self-service booking and update notifications. 

The fundamental aim of GP Talk is to provide a comprehensive booking service to all registered users wishing to make appointments with their desired General Practitioner. Users are exposed to all assistant features such as a personalised scheduler which keeps track of all currently requested, confirmed and rejected bookings and a calendar interface that is automatically updated with confirmed scheduled bookings. Patients are additionally provided with detailed information of all available GPs, including a marked view of the GP’s location via Google Maps. The maintainability of a user’s personal account is accessible within the application.

Communication between the user and the GP’s Android devices comes in the form of a Google Cloud Messaging service. All consultation details are securely stored within a remote MySQL database, in which data is sent to the application on the device of the intended receiver, and is used to automatically update features of the application.

A corresponding website entitled GPTalk.ie is available and provides additional content based on the application, such as downloadable files, documentation and video tutorials. The website is an alternative source of registration and login to an account for maintainability purposes.

The application has been constructed using the Android SDK, Java, PHP and XML.
